# Installation
- grab the zip file for your OS from <a href = "https://github.com/o7Moon/racing-game/releases/tag/1.0">releases</a>
- unzip it somewhere
- run the executable (exe for windows, x86_64 for linux)

# How To Play
## Movement
- air movement is quake-based, with a dynamic "max speed" that updates when you're on the ground.
- ground movement is very simple, no max speed, multiplicative friction.
- you can slide on the ground or for a short time after leaving the ground. sliding applies a force in the direction of your acceleration and lowers you hitbox.

## Flags
- There are six flags near landmarks in the map.
- By walking to a flag, you can select one of the other flags and start a speedrun from the flag you're standing at to the one you selected.
- you can press escape to quit the current speedrun.
- you can also press escape while in the select screen to exit it.

## Tips
- do a slide, then a jump, then <a href="https://youtu.be/rTsXO6Zicls">air strafe</a>, and repeat when you land. This is a very good way to build momentum but you'll want to stay away from uphills as they'll slow you down.
- you can change the mouse sensitivity with the slider in the bottom of the pause menu.
- the force from sliding is parallel to the ground you stand on. This means that sliding on a slope and then jumping results in a large amount of vertical veloicity.
